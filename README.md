Just a small script I always make sure to include in every server I install.  

What is this, and why?  Whenever I set up a server I always make sure there is something there to force my morale.  I love servers, however sometimes things can get frustrating.  Thus, I install these packages.

- sl (because it's hilarious).
- htop (it's a nice way of quickly seeing what's going on, and is better looking than top)
- moon-buggy (entertainment)
- cowsay (for the login messages)
- fortune (gives the messages for the cowsay program to...say)
